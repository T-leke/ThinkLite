# ThinkLite
A lightweight, Rust-powered educational database built from scratch. Designed to explore storage engines, SQL parsing, query execution, and distributed systems with a future AI agent for automated insights.

ThinkLite is intentionally minimal, transparent, and educational.  
It aims to teach:

- Low-level systems programming with Rust  
- Database architecture and internals  
- Storage engines (pages, record formats, heaps)  
- SQL parsing and AST construction  
- Query planning and execution  
- B+ tree indexing  
- Write-ahead logging and basic transactions  
- Distributed database concepts (RPC, leader/follower replication, sharding)  
- Building an agentic layer for automated analytical insights  

ThinkLite begins as a single-node, file-backed database and later extends into a distributed system with remote nodes and replication. In Phase 2, an agent will be added on top, enabling natural-language insights and intelligent query generation.
